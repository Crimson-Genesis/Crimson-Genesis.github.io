## About

My work revolves around five core areas:  
Distributed systems, Cybersecurity, Low-level programming, Algorithmic reasoning, and Applied AI engineering.  
Not treated as separate skills, but as parts of one engineering approach.  

Distributed systems come first — building, scaling, and understanding how real systems behave under load, failure, latency, and orchestration.  
Cybersecurity supports it by exposing the real boundaries, attack surfaces, and weak links inside those systems.  
Low-level programming gives control over memory, execution, optimization, and the actual mechanics of how software runs.  
Algorithms matter when building compilers, schedulers, simulations, and tools that require structure and efficiency.  
AI is a tool, not a goal — used to automate, extend, or enhance systems when needed.  

Years of work across Linux development, custom OS building, compilers across multiple languages, reverse engineering game engines, ZeroMQ simulation pipelines, and distributed toolchains define the direction: A focused path toward high-level R&D engineering with depth in the three primary domains and support from the other two.  

No unnecessary complexity.  
No surface-level knowledge.  
Just systems understood deeply and built correctly.  

## Core Axes

# **Distributed & Cloud-Native Systems**

* Kubernetes, Docker, container runtimes
* ZeroMQ IPC pipelines and multi‑process topologies
* Fault‑tolerant orchestration and distributed scheduling
* Local multi‑cluster simulation environments
* Workload design for heavy scientific and simulation tasks

> Distributed systems form the execution layer for simulation, AI, security telemetry, and system tools.

# **Offensive Security & Reverse Engineering**

* Protocol analysis, network surface mapping
* Binary introspection and runtime tracing
* Vulnerability analysis and exploit‑path reasoning
* Engine reversing: Unity, Unreal, VN systems, RPG Maker
* Structured file decoding (`.pak`, `.unity3d`, `.resources`, `.rpyc`)
* Automated extraction pipelines (QuickBMS, AssetStudio, NinjaRipper)

> Security exposes the real structure beneath systems, compilers, and distributed architectures.

# **Systems-Level & Low-Level Engineering**

* Custom Linux distro engineering
* Kernel and subsystem customization
* Runtime memory modeling and instruction‑level reasoning
* Toolchains across C, Rust, Go, Python
* Cryptographic pipelines (GCM, ChaCha20)
* Neovim API configuration and workflow automation

> System internals anchor security, distribution, and simulation.

## Direction & Goals

Long‑term focus: becoming a **Pentagon‑grade systems engineer** — combining distributed architecture, adversarial reasoning, system internals, and simulation‑driven R&D into a single engineering discipline.  
The aim is mastery of interaction: how systems behave, break, scale, and transform.

## Current Stack

**Languages:** C, Python, Rust, Go, Shell, x86  
**Systems:** Linux (Arch/custom), Docker, Kubernetes, ZeroMQ  
**Tools:** Neovim, tmux, Git, FFmpeg, analyzers  
**Domains:** Distributed systems, security, system internals, simulation, compiler engineering
